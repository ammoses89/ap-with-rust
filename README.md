Architecture Patterns with Python (with Rust)


These are my recreation of examples in the book Architecture Patterns with Rust (Percival & Gregory) as I go through each chapter of the book.

The examples are written in Rust as I'm new to rust and want to learn the language while also grounding myself in modern design patterns.

Purchase the book here.
